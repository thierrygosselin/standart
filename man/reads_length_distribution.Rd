\usage{
reads_length_distribution(
  fq.files,
  parallel.core = parallel::detectCores() - 1,
  with.future = FALSE,
  chunk.size = 1e+06,
  show.progress = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fq.files}{(character, path) A character vector of paths to FASTQ files or a folder containing FASTQ files.
Default: \code{fq.files = "my-sample.fq.gz"}.}

\item{parallel.core}{(integer) Number of cores to use when with.future is TRUE.
Default: \code{parallel.core = parallel::detectCores() - 1}.}

\item{with.future}{(logical) Whether to use parallel processing via the future package.
Default: \code{with.future = FALSE}.}

\item{chunk.size}{(integer) Number of reads per chunk to stream from each FASTQ file.
Default: \code{chunk.size = 1e6}.}

\item{show.progress}{(logical) Whether to display a progress bar.
Default: \code{show.progress = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns: FILE and READ_LENGTH.
}
\description{
This function reads the fastq file of an individual, lane/chip or
entire folder of fastq files.
The read length distribution is generated and saved in the working directory.
This helps to decide the threshold to cut the reads to a specific length.

This function reads FASTQ files corresponding to a single individual, a sequencing lane/chip,
or an entire folder containing multiple FASTQ files. It generates a distribution of read lengths,
which is saved to the working directory.

This distribution can be used to determine an appropriate threshold for keeping or
trimming reads of a specific length.

coming soon, just try it in the meantime...
